3) Android Project

Final Project for my Mobile Computing course. It is programmed in java and intended for an android device. It asks for an input (title of the movie/show, what type (movie/series/etc),year it released). After the input, the application navigates to the IMDb website and outputs to the screen several information about the requested movie/show. 

4) Back End Project

Final Project for my Back End Web Development course.

5) Car Game

Final Project for my Computer Graphics course. It is programmed in C++ and implemented for an OpenGL application. Every model in the game is created from scratch, and acts as a 3D racing game that checks for collisions in every obstacle and keeps track of a score until the final goal is reached.

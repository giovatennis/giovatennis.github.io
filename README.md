Here are some projects that I developed on my own during my undergraduate degree and Master's degree. 

1) Blackjack game Project:

Blackjack game developed in Unity using C#. It acts as a 2D game, where the user plays against the dealer with the same rules as the traditional casino game. Files are too big to upload in github, so here is a google drive link for it instead: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mra9jTlKnBGJydOOsox1L7lBZdbAm0sV/view?usp=sharing

2) Halloween Project:

My first simple website, developed using HTML, CSS. Not extremely elaborated since it was created for the purpose of understanding the basics of front-end design.

3) Class Project:

Final Project for my Front Web Development course. Developed a fully functional website that simulates one of a Computer Science Department at a univerisity. It uses HTML, CSS, and javascript (for implementing a GPA calculator).

4) Android Project

Final Project for my Mobile Computing course. It is programmed in java and intended for an android mobile device (developed in android studio). It asks for an input (title, what type is it (ex. movie/series/short/episode,etc.), year of release). After the input, the user submits the request and the application navigates to the IMDb website, which then outputs to the screen some information about the requested title.

5) Back End Project

My first elaborated website using Front and Back-end design. It is programmed with HTML, CSS, Php and mySql database server. It is a university website from the perspective of a student account. It starts with a log in page that requests a username and password (can create a user if you dont have an account yet), then several options are presented. You can view the classes you are enrolled in, and add/drop more courses. You can look at the instructors in the university and which courses they teach. All of these information are obtained from several queries from the database server which is showed instantly on the website.

6) Car Game

Final Project for my Computer Graphics course. It is programmed in C++ and implemented for an OpenGL application. In the program every model is created from scratch, and acts as a 3D racing game that checks for collisions in every obstacle and keeps track of a score until the final goal is reached.

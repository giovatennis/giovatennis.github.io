These are some projects that I developed on my own during my undergraduate degree and Master's degree. 

1) Blackjack game Project:

Blackjack game developed in Unity using C#. It acts as a 2D game, where the user plays against the dealer with the same rules as the traditional casino game. Files are too big to upload in github, so I provided a google drive link for it instead: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mra9jTlKnBGJydOOsox1L7lBZdbAm0sV/view?usp=sharing

2) Back End Project

My first website using Front and Back-end design, programmed with HTML, CSS, Php and mySql database server. It is an university's website from the perspective of a student user. It starts with a log in page that requests a username and password (can create a user if you dont have an account yet), then several options are presented: You can view the classes you are enrolled in, and add/drop more courses. You can look at the instructors in the university and which courses they teach. All of this information is obtained from several queries from the database server which are shown instantly on the website.

3) Android Project

Final Project for my Mobile Computing course, programmed in java and intended for an android mobile device (developed in android studio). It asks for an input (title, what type is it (ex. movie/series/short/episode,etc.), year of release). After the input, the user submits the request and the application navigates to the IMDb website, which then outputs to the screen some information about the requested title.

4) Car Game

Final Project for my Computer Graphics course. It is programmed in C++ and implemented for an OpenGL application. In the program every model is created from scratch, and acts as a 3D racing game that checks for collisions in every obstacle and keeps track of a score until the final goal is reached.
